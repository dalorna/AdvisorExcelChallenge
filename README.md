A simple banking app requested by Advisors Excel

# Getting Started with the banking app
I use webstorm, however; vscode should work in getting the project up and running.

1. Open a terminal to the client folder and do a npm install
2. Open a terminal to the server folder and do a npm install
3. after both npm installs are done we can start the server (in terminal for the server) by npm start
    1. make sure you see the server has started on port: 3001
4. once the server is started we can run the client (in the terminal for the client) by npm start you should see something like below
    1. You can now view client in the browser.
    2. Local:            http://localhost:3000
    3. On Your Network:  http://192.168.12.106:3000
5. The home page should pop up with some instructions on how to use the app
